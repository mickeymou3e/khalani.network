Your information and the Blockchain</h3>\n      <p>\n        Blockchains, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply &lsquo;DLT&rsquo;), are made up of digitally\n        recorded data in a chain of packages called &lsquo;blocks&rsquo;. The manner in which these blocks are linked is\n        chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be\n        distributed all over the world (across several &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; which usually replicate the ledger) this\n        means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a\n        cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Accordingly, by design, records of a Blockchain cannot be changed or deleted and are said to be\n        &lsquo;immutable&rsquo;. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure\n        (&lsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo;), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data.\n        Data on the Blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke\n        certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of\n        Tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Wallet address, onto the Blockchain;\n        this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your Wallet&rsquo;s\n        Private Key.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the Blockchain using your Wallet, as well as (ii) share the\n        Public Key relating to your Wallet with anyone (including us) rests with you.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS\n        CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF\n        THE BLOCKCHAIN.
