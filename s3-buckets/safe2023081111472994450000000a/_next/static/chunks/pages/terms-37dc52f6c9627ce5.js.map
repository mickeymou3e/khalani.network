The Safe App may be used to manage your personal digital assets\n        on Ethereum and other common EVM chains when you connect a Safe Account with third-party&nbsp;services (as\n        defined below). The Safe App provides certain features that may be amended from time to time.{' '}\n      </p>\n      <ol start={3}>\n        <li>&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps&rdquo;</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n        The Safe App allows you to connect Safe Accounts to third-party decentralized applications\n        (&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps&rdquo;) and use third-party&nbsp;services such as from the decentralized\n        finance sector, DAO Tools or services related to NFTs (&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Services&quot;). The\n        Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps are integrated in the user interface of the Safe App via inline framing. The provider\n        of the Third-Party&nbsp;Safe App and related Third-Party Service is responsible for the operation of the service\n        and the correctness, completeness and actuality of any information provided therein. We make a pre-selection of\n        Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps that we show in the Safe App. However, we only perform a rough triage in advance for\n        obvious problems and functionality in terms of loading time and resolution capability of the transactions.\n        Accordingly, in the event of any (technical) issues concerning the Third-Party Services, the user must only\n        contact the respective service provider directly. The terms of service, if any, shall be governed by the\n        applicable contractual provisions between the User and the respective provider of the Third-Party&nbsp;Service.\n        Accordingly, we are not liable in the event of a breach of contract, damage or loss related to the use of such\n        Third-Party Service.\n      </p>\n      <h3>4.
