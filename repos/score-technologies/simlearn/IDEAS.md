# Neural Network Architecture Ideas for Soccer Prediction

## Intermediate Targets

### Ball Control & Possession
1. **Nearest Team Prediction**
   - Binary classification: which team is closer to the ball
   - Could be used as an auxiliary loss
   - Helps network learn basic positioning concepts

2. **Ball Control Probability**
   - Predict probability of each team controlling the ball several time steps ahead
   - Consider distances and velocities in a similar vein to the ball anticipation model

### Physical Predictions
1. **Ball Trajectory**
   - Predict future ball position given current state (already in the anticipation model)
   - Use physics-informed layers (friction, acceleration)
   - Could be used as pre-training task

2. **Player Reach Time**
   - Estimate time for defending player to reach the ball
  

### Strategic Features
1. **Space Control**
   - Predict areas controlled by each team (e.g. 2d kernel around players and add)
   - Use Voronoi diagrams as supervision
   - Could help understand territorial advantage

2. **Defensive Coverage**
   - Measure how well each goal is protected
   - Consider angles and distances to goal
   - Important for understanding scoring threats

## Architecture Ideas

### Multi-Task Learning
1. **Hierarchical Prediction**
   ```
   Input -> Common Features -> [
       Ball Control Branch,
       Territory Branch,
       Outcome Branch
   ]
   ```
   - Share early layers
   - Use intermediate predictions as inputs to final outcome

2. **Physics-Informed Layers**
   - Dedicated layers for physical motion
   - Learnable parameters for friction, player speeds
   - Combine with neural layers for tactical understanding

### Attention Mechanisms
1. **Ball-Centric Attention**
   - Use ball position as query
   - Keys/values from player positions
   - Learn which players are relevant to current play

2. **Goal-Oriented Attention**
   - Use goal positions as fixed queries
   - Learn to assess threat/opportunity levels
   - Could help understand scoring chances

### Symmetry-Aware Design
1. **Field Symmetries**
   - Enforce invariance to field reflections
   - Share weights between similar tactical situations
   - Reduce required training data

2. **Team Symmetries**
   - Handle home/away teams consistently
   - Learn team-independent tactical principles
   - Better generalization to new situations

## Training Strategies

### Curriculum Learning
1. **Physical First**
   - Start with pure physics predictions
   - Gradually introduce tactical complexity
   - Help network learn basic laws first

2. **Local to Global**
   - Begin with local interactions (ball control)
   - Progress to medium-range (territory)
   - Finally learn full game outcomes

### Auxiliary Tasks
1. **Physics Consistency**
   - Add losses for physical law compliance
   - Penalize impossible player movements
   - Ensure predictions respect game constraints

2. **Time-Scale Hierarchy**
   - Short-term physical predictions
   - Medium-term tactical predictions
   - Long-term strategic outcomes

## Future Directions

### Hybrid Models
1. **Physics + Neural**
   - Combine explicit physics engines with neural nets
   - Use physics for motion, neural for decisions
   - Better interpretability and generalization

2. **Rule-Based + Learned**
   - Incorporate game rules explicitly
   - Learn patterns within rule constraints
   - More reliable predictions

### Advanced Features
1. **Formation Analysis**
   - Learn to recognize team formations
   - Understand formation advantages
   - Predict formation effectiveness

2. **Player Roles**
   - Learn position-specific behaviors
   - Understand role interactions
   - Better tactical understanding

## Implementation Priority
1. Ball Control Prediction (immediate, helps verify architecture)
2. Physics-Informed Layers (improve motion understanding)
3. Multi-Task Learning (leverage intermediate predictions)
4. Attention Mechanisms (capture relevant interactions)
5. Advanced Features (add as refinements)
