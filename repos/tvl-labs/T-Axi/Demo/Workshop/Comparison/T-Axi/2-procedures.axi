// Unlike in A-Axi, in T-Axi tactics comprise a layer of its own, separate from
// the logic layer. For now, there are no tactics in the demo, despite the fact
// that the most common proof style was called "tactic style". To make it clear:
// these "tactics" are just a different syntax for proofterms. The real tactics
// will come later.
