Khalani operates as a multi-chain asset issuer, issuing its own liabilities against user deposits across its balance sheets on all supported chains. This allows the protocol to convert chain-specific liquidity into fungible, inter-chain native liquidity, facilitating inter-chain liquidity bridging.

Khalani issues the following assets:

- **klnUSDC**: an inter-chain fungible token pegged to the canonical USDC, backed by Khalani's multi-chain USDC reserves.
- **klnUSDT**: an inter-chain fungible token pegged to the canonical USDT, backed by Khalani's multi-chain USDT reserves.
- **Kai**: Inter-chain fungible token pegged to the US Dollar, initially backed by klnUSDC and klnUSDT, with plans to expand to other major cryptocurrencies as collateral. Kai essentially represents globally aggregated liquidity for all USD pegged stablecoins.
- **klnCrypto**: Khalani plans to issue assets pegged to major cryptocurrencies, backed by its multi-chain reserves. These include klnBTC, klnETH and others.

Viewed in this light, Khalani functions like a combination of a multi-chain asset issuer and forex exchange. The external blockchains are where Khalani keeps its balance sheet assets, while the Khalani Chain is the platform for asset issuance, accounting, and exchange execution.
