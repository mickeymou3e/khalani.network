# Getting Started with Khalani

There are two main actors in the Khalani protocol

- [Bridgers](brigding.md) : These are users that wish to transfer tokens from one chain to another
- [Liquidity Providers](liquidity_providers.md): These are users that provide assets to pools for cross-chain liquidity. In exchange for this service, they earn protocol fees.
