| Collaborative Filling           | A subset of Collaborative Solving in Khalani, where multiple intents can be fulfilled by various solvers, each bringing unique capabilities to address different aspects of a given intent.                                                                                                            |
| Collaborative Solving           | Khalani's core functionality, enabling different agents or solvers to specialize in distinct stages of the intent lifecycle. It offers a platform for solvers to express preferences, coordinate in a trustless manner, and verify the authenticity of their inputs.                                    |
| Cross Chain Market Maker (CCMM) | An off-chain agent in Khalani that actively creates markets through continuous Limit Orders (LOs) using pre-defined market-making strategies. This role is crucial for maintaining liquidity and market stability.                                                                                    |
| IntentBook                      | A multi-dimensional order book in Khalani, where solvers express their intents for spoke chains, liquidity management (via limit orders), or execution strategies. It's a central hub for managing and pairing trading intents.                                                                      |
| IntentBook Match Maker          | A solver in Khalani responsible for analyzing bids in the IntentBook and matching them with corresponding asks or counterparties. This role is vital in facilitating the efficient pairing of trade interests.                                                                                        |
| Interchain Security Module      | In Hyperlane, these are adaptable modules allowing applications to authenticate messages based on customized security criteria. They are essential for maintaining the integrity and security of cross-chain communications.                                                                         |
| LimitOrderIntentBook            | A specific type of IntentBook in Khalani where the Cross Chain Market Maker (CCMM) posts limit orders. These orders are then available for Swap Intent Settlers, or any interested solvers, to manage their inventory on the Khalani chain.                                                          |
| Solvers                         | Agents in Khalani that decompose intents into various parts and possess capabilities to address different stages of the intent lifecycle. Examples include the IntentBook Match Maker, Cross Chain Market Maker, Spoke Chain Caller, and Swap Intent Settler.                                         |
| SpokeChainCallIntentBook        | An intent book in Khalani dedicated to spoke chain calls. Solvers needing spoke chain calls post their requests here, and agents equipped with the necessary inventory and infrastructure on spoke chains can respond to these requests.                                                             |
