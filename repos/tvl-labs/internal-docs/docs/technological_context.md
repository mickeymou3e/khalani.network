| UniswapX                     | Uniswap X, an evolution of the Uniswap protocol, transitions from transaction-based to intent-based swaps. It engages Market Makers to provide quotes, fill orders, and then moves orders to an auction where off-chain fillers, similar to Khalani solvers, compete to fulfill them. Initially single-chain, UniswapX's whitepaper also suggests a cross-chain version. The whitepaper link is currently down; efforts are underway to restore access.                                                         | [Uniswap X Whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-uniswapx.pdf)                                                                                           |
| xyk                          | xyk refers to bots developed by Aori that emulate Constant Function Market Making (CFMM) strategies.
