# Retrospective : Milestone 1 (23-02-23)

## Summary

### What went well

- Everyone is productive. 
- Fast feedback loops.
- Onboarding Jay.
- Better atmosphere with Hadouken.

### What can be improved

- DeFi Native: We can't innovate we do not thoroughly understand. It is important that team members start to use more DeFi protocols.
- Design Process: We should be more rigorous / methodical in our approach, expanding on the realm of possibilities , documenting our rationale , and soliciting feedback from teammates.
- Better asynchronous communication: We need to document decisions and thought processes better .
- Onboarding document: New developers struggle to get up to speed. We should provide better onboarding resources, and curate a knowledge base.
- Open Forum for discussion: We should refrain from communicating via DM.
- Task definitions: We should improve on defining tasks better , as this would lead to an improvement in developer velocity.
