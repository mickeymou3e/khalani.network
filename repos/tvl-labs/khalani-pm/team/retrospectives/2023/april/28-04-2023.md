## DeFi

Konrad

* [Rhino fi](https://rhino.fi/). [Portfolio history pages](https://app.rhino.fi/account) might be something we can adapt use for Khalani.

Jay

* [GND protocol](https://gndprotocol.com/): Interesting tokenomics , arbitrum
* [Thala (Aptos)](https://app.thala.fi/account)
* [Astroport now cross chain ; Injective](https://blog.astroport.fi/post/astroport-arrives-on-injective-mainnet)

Sergei/ Daniel

* Frax and Balancer ; Wanting to deploy pools to understand SOR.
  
Manmeet

* [Gearbox](https://gearbox.fi/) ; credit accounts act as wallets on protocols, adapters make it very easy to integrate stuff. [White paper](https://docs.gearbox.finance/overview/whitepaper) should be read.  
* [Pendle.fi](https://www.pendle.finance/): [New version , yield tokenizationn and AMM](https://beincrypto.com/pendle-introduces-v2-as-the-one-stop-yield-trading-protocol/)
* EIPs : [6916 (Automatic Reset of Testnet)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6916/files), [6822 (Sharable interface for Borrowing )](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6882), [3900 - Modular Smart Contracts](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-modular-smart-contract-accounts-and-plugins/13885)
  
Kevin

* [GMX](https://gmx.io/#/): v2 , which is really interesting , still digging into it , seperate assets in different pairs  , as an LP , you have to provide liquidity targeting a specific pair  . Better risk management , less capital efficient. Need to look to more resources to understand what is the current issue with the mdoel
* [Perenial](<https://perennial.finance/>) 
* [Vesta Finance](<https://vestafinance.xyz/>): Liquity fork on Arbitrum.

Sam  

* [Primitive Finance](https://www.primitive.xyz/): Their fvm and [arbiter](https://www.primitive.xyz/blog/introducing_arbiter) seems pretty interesting . Will allow economic simulation of transactions in a evm like environment , which sets it apart from most simiulation tools like cadCad , and make the types of simulations Gaunlet run more accessible.
