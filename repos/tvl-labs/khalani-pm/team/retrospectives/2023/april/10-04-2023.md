| Sergei  | The team was performant , being able to recover the chain over a short amount of time      | The onboarding experience left alot to be desired.

## Interesting Defi

**Chris**:

- Zksync : zkSync era launched, alot of airdrop farming activity. While most things are copy pastas, zkSync offers a gas rebate feature that could be of interest to us.

**Kevin**:

- Euler : Hacker returned monies. Sam and Kevin are rich again.
- Solidly:
  - Uses a different curve from uniswap , which means they always get some trade flow.
  - Listing strategy is interesting, they take bets on emerging token ecosystems.
