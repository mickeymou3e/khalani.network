# Research

## Overview
This repository contains the outcome of internal research activities in Khalani project.
The goal is to keep record of the research paths, so that motivation and the history is kept
for further reference.

This repository is supposed to be private.

The final specifications and public research reports should be published elsewhere.

# Things to find here
- [Questions](general-questions.md) - general partitioning of the problem space via "master catalog of big questions/goals"
- [Research log](research-log.md) - linear "log" of the research work (with comments and links)
- [Knowledge base](exploration-buffer.md) - List of resources waiting to be explored (and why); can be seen as the main knowledge base 
- [Joining path](joining-path) - List of "must read" documents/books/articles for any person that wants to join the research; This is supposed to be a "minimalistic" subset of the knowledge base

# Research mindmap
A visual mindmap of the research space is maintained outside of this repo and can be found here:
[Mindmap](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/64348038bb9b4813b215d6297f9773d0)

The mindmap uses coloring convention (i.e. node colors are meaningful) which is explained here:
