## The Bear Market

In a bull market, the most effective GTM is to jump on hype trains and generate social proof (investors, KOLs, content, etc) to pump the token price, then spend the token to generate real value for self-fulfilling cycles. In a bear market, investors are generally risk averse and skeptical of unproven tokens.  Intead of finding the most promising story to ape in, attention shifts to how to generate safe returns on capital sitting on the sideline in stables or major cryptos (BTC, ETH, etc).

To attract users and capital in this environment, we have to establish the following:

1) Credibility of the project. There isn't a silver bullet here, and we'll have to do a lot of the legwork.

- establish the credibility of the team and the vision. Be visible and be able to present our point of view in serious conversations.
- education as marketing. be a source of information and establish ourselves as authorities in the space.
- hang out with the cool guys.  Establish credibility by association.

2) Vanity metrics

- TVL
- Volume
- PCV / Treasury
- Number of integrations

3) Penetrate communities

- Every L1, L2, DAO, token project is a community. We need to find the water holes, connectors, amplifiers of each community, participate and provide complementary value.

# Phase One

### Finding Sustainable Yield

We need to find a sustainable yield source for liquidity providers. I'd target at least 6-10% given the early phase nature of the project. Anything lower than this would be difficult to attract capital.

1) Be the bridge of choice for Godwoken to other major blockchains.
2) Market make and arbitrage our own stable pools with centralized exchanges or other DEXes. Need to build bots.
3) PCV investments into bluechip Defi apps on connected chains.

Out of the three above, 2) and 3) are scaling to TVL, but the effect of 1) will drop off as TVL increases.

### Vanity Metrics

There are four Vanity Metrics:

- TVL
- Volume
- PCV / Treasury
- Number of integrations

Out of the above 4, volume is the easiest to engineer, if we launch with a very low fee. As an example, Balancer's flagship stable pool has 0.01% fee (used to be 0.001% not too long ago), so it takes $100 to generate $1,000,000 of volume.

I think building a bot to arb USDC, USDT and BUSD's price deviation on CEX or other low cost DEX could generate a lot of volume with acceptable risk (Note: this applies to Hadouken as well)

As an example, currently on Binance:

- 0 fee, good volume and meaningful fluctuation for trading BUSD / USDT
- auto convert USDC, USDP and TUSD to BUSD
- BSC can serve as the onramp to binance

If we launch with a 0.01% fee, and assuming a bot that aims merely break-even, just through eyeballing the USDT/BUSD pair on Binance it seems we're going to generate significant trading volume and fees.

Low fees will bring some aggregator (like Li.Fi) volume as well.
