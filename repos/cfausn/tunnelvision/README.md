(make sure you set to high definition!)

## TECHNICAL PREREQUISITES 

1. Must have MongoDB installed and running (without auth)
2. Must have npm installed
3. Must be running from a linux terminal

Please ensure that you have npm installed before running the stack. You may also need to give execution permission to the script by running `chmod +x start-both.sh` before running `./start-both.sh`.
